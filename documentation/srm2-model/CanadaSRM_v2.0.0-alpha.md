**Abstract**
Individuals, businesses and government leaders are increasingly receptive to the principles of disaster resilience planning, but are unlikely to take actions in advance of a disaster without a clearly defined value proposition. While the rationale and evidence for substantial financial returns on risk reduction investments are well known, there remain significant barriers in transforming this knowledge into actions that are required on the ground to reduce the impacts of future disaster events. As a result, the short-term economic gains of continued urban growth and development that are driving escalating trends in vulnerability and risk are increasingly outpacing the willingness of individuals, businesses and institutions to invest in longer-term disaster resilience strategies. To address this challenge, we introduce a national earthquake risk model to establish an open and accessible base of evidence to inform disaster resilience planning in accordance with policy guidelines established as part of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (United Nations, 2015: SFDRR). Canada's national earthquake model extends the scope of probabilistic seismic hazard assessments currently used to inform Canada’s National Building Code (NBCC) by introducing a structured framework of indicators that profile the physical, social and economic dimensions of earthquake risk at the neighborhood scale. Risk metrics are used to both analyze existing baseline conditions of earthquake risk, and to evaluate opportunities for risk reduction through proactive investments in seismic mitigation and post-disaster recovery planning. 

## Introduction
Canada is exposed to rare but potentially devastating earthquake hazards in hotspot areas along the active plate margin of British Columbia and the Yukon, along the Saint Lawrence and Ottawa valley regions of Quebec and Ontario, and along coastal maritime regions of Newfoundland, Labrador and Nunavut.  Although less frequent than floods, wildfire and other hazards of concern, a single earthquake event has the potential for human and economic losses that are greater than the combined effects of all disaster events experienced in Canada over the past 200 years.  The anticipated physical impacts and socioeconomic consequences of a severe earthquake event near densely settled areas of British Columbia and Quebec exceed current risk tolerance thresholds for private sector insurance markets, and would likely strain federal emergency backstop measures and existing capacities for recovery at all levels of government (Le Pan, 2016).

The lived experiences and knowledge embedded in the stories of indigenous communities document a history of devestating earthquake and related tsunami events spanning several thousand years of human settlement along Canada's western coast (refs).  These stories, combined with post-colonial documents dating back to the early 1600's (Lamontagne et al.,2018) preserve a record of more than ~700 earthquake rupture events across Canada that exceeded thresholds of groundshaking capable of causing significant physical impacts and related downstream consequences. More recent scientific research and insights gained through seismic monitoring of earthquake activity in Canada over the last ~60 years have increased our understanding of the earth system processes that generate extreme seismic hazards (Adams et al., 2020; Cassidy et al., 2009). 

It is reasonable to expect from our current understanding that a severe earthquake is almost certain to occur within the foreseeable future. Nonetheless, our ability to predict exactly when or where the next catastrophic earthquake will occur remains limited by the level of system complexity and the inherent variability of large-scale tectonic processes that operate over long geologic time frames and vast geographic regions.  These limitations are compounded by ambiguity about who is responsible for managing the inevitable consequences of these events, and the broader societal benefits of investing in mitigation and/or adaptation measures. As a result, the short-term economic gains of continued urban growth and development that are driving escalating trends of vulnerability and risk in hazard-prone areas  are increasingly outpacing the willingness of individuals, businesses and institutions to invest in longer-term disaster resilience strategies.
  
Based on a comprehensive review of over 4,000 federal mitigation programs commissioned by the US National Institute of Building Sciences (Multihazard Mitigation Council, 2005, 2017), researchers found that one dollar in mitigation investments by federal agencies in the US result in four dollars of accrued benefits. Complementary studies of global disaster risk reduciton efforts have shown that the benefits of proactive investments in mitigation and adaptation can outweigh the costs by a factor of ~5:1 for damaging earthquakes (Shreve & Kelman, 2014).  While the rationale and evidence for substantial returns on disaster risk reduction investments are clear, there remain significant barriers in transforming this knowledge into actions that are needed to build disaster resilience at the community level in Canada.  Recent studies have noted that failures to invest in mitigation and adaptation measures are most often due to a lack of shared understanding about the likely impacts and consequences of plausible hazard threats, and fundamental biases in how we make decisions and plan for the future in situations where the risks are embedded within systems that are inherently complex and uncertain (Kunreuther, 2016; Rose, 2016). This is particularly challenging in the context of low-probability/high consequence earthquake hazards that pose a significant threat to settled areas across Canada. 

To address this challenge, we present an earthquake risk model for Canada (CanadaSRM2) that establishes a base of evidence to both inform and empower disaster resilience planning in accordance with policy and technical implementation guidelines established as part of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (United Nations, 2015). The study utilizes integrated risk assessment methods and emerging best practices of risk governance to develop a more holistic view of both physical and social dimensions of earthquake risk in Canada. It re-frames the risk assessment process around risk reduction strategies (planning scenarios) that have a potential to increase capabilities for recovery following a disaster event, and structures the decision making process using performance measures that highlight the value proposition for proactive investment in mitigation and adaptation. 

The model is implemented using [GEM’s OpenQuake Engine](https://www.globalquakemodel.org/openquake) (Keller & Schneider, 2014; Pagani et al., 2014; Silva et al., 2014); and available public domain information from [Canada’s National Census](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/). It extends the scope of probabilistic seismic hazard assessments carried out by the Geological Survey of Canada to inform the National Building Code (see: [CanSHM2](https://github.com/OpenDRR/CanadaSHM6)) by introducing a structured framework of indicators that profile the physical, social and economic dimensions of earthquake risk at the neighborhood scale. Indicators are aligned with the SFDRR monitoring framework and are used to both analyze existing baseline conditions of earthquake risk, and to evaluate opportunities for risk reduction through proactive investments in seismic mitigation.

## Integrated Risk Assessment
Disaster resilience planning is a forward-looking process of analysis and deliberation through which knowledge about the risk environment is used to develop actionable strategies that increase the safety and security of a community and its capacity to respond and recover from hazard threats of concern. The conventional approach to risk-based planning involves a process quantitative assessment and rational choice that is focused on determining an appropriate future course of action based on the utility of alternate strategies and the likelihood of achieving the intended outcome. It is a means of structuring the risk management process around principles of rational behaviour whereby a set of policy alternatives are put forward for consideration, consequences are scientiﬁcally assessed and analyzed, and a course of action is selected based on ranking policy alternatives in terms of overall performance (Simon, 1955; Davidoff and Reiner, 1962). It is often referred to as a science-based approach to decision making, and typically involves site-level engineering assessments of individual structures to evaluate conformance with design guideliens embedded in national building codes (refs).

This study adopts a framework for disaster resilience planning that utilizes methods of integrated assessment and scenario modelling to help articulate the combined physical impacts and socioeconomic consequences of disaster events (baseline conditions), and to evaluate both the effectiveness and desirability of alternate risk reduction actions (planning scenarios) thorugh the lens of policy goals and trade-offs (Figure x). Integrated assessment is an alternate form of risk-based planning that blends analytic and deliberative methods to assist planners in developing evidence-based policy recommendations that are actionable, informed by the best available science, and governed by value-based judgments that reﬂect the principles, goals and objectives of those impacted by the decisionmaking process [Alcamo and Rothman, 2004; Engels, 2005; Jaeger, 1998; Pahl-Wostl et al., 2000; J Rotmans, 2006; Jan Rotmans and Van Asselt, 2000; Turner et al., 2003]. 

Knowledge and understanding developed through analysis and exploration of risk profiles is used to evaluate policy alternatives based on a framework of performance metrics (indicators) that seek to balance trade-offs between growth opportunities and the constraints of development in areas exposed to natural hazards. Quantitative methods of integrated risk assessment are used to analyze cause-effect relationships and likely impacts and consequences for hazard threats of concern.  Design-based methods of participatory planning and scenario modelling are used to establish decision protocols and to evaluate policy alternatives based on negotiated thresholds of risk tolerance. The framework is aligned with national and international standards for risk management [Australia/New Zealand Standards, 2006; CAN/CSA-Z1600, 2008; ISO 31000, 2008], and incorporates best practices for risk governance and disaster resilience planning [International Risk Governance Council, 2008; Renn, 2006b].  

> Figure x: Overall framework and workflow of integrated assessment and scenario planning methods used to develop the National Seimsic Risk Model for Canada

Methods of integrated assessment and scenario planning provide the necessary spatial and temporal context for understanding risk and evaluating plausible mitigation alternatives. They also provide a means of structuring the decision-making process and a capability to integrate objective and value-based measures of risk to support strategic decisions about mitigation choices and their likely consequences (Goodwin and Wright, 2001; Belton and Stewart, 2002; Swart et al., 2004; Montibeller et al., 2006). Choices are based on decision criteria that reconcile tensions between a “willingness to pay” for investment in risk treatment options and a “willingness to accept” trade-offs between objectives in order to achieve a desired set of outcomes that balance collective risks and beneﬁts. The ﬁrst is based primarily on rational analysis and optimization while the latter is based on principles of integrated assessment and adaptive planning. Both involve the use of scenario planning and multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA; McDaniels and Thomas, 1999; Costa, 2001; Omann, 2004; Linkov et al., 2006a).

Outputs of an integrated risk assessment provide a capability to evaluate whether existing or planned activities meet regulatory guidelines and are considered “safe for the intended use”; and whether they are consistent with what the community considers a “tolerable threshold of risk”. Planning scenarios that meet these minimum thresholds are advanced for further policy analysis and the selection of actionable strategies that can be implemented within the limits of available resources.  Planning scenarios that fail to meet these minimum thresholds can be modified by adjusting seismic design measures to increase the performance of selected target criteria, or re-negotiating levels of risk that the community is willing to live with.When formulated with a desired future state in mind, planning scenarios offer a forward-looking perspective for characterizing thresholds of tolerability based on community values, and for evaluating the efficacy of mitigation and/or adaptation strategies through the lens of local preferences and established policy guidelines. When incorporated into the full cycle of risk-based planning, the outputs of integrated risk assessment and scenario modelling offer decision makers a structured, transparent, and evidence-based framework for evaluating policy alternatives and choosing a course of action that advances overall community objectives while minimizing any potential negative impacts on people and critical assets.

## Earthquake Risk Modeling
OpenQuake is an open-source computational platform developed and mainatained by the Global Earthquake Model Foundation to support integrated seismic hazard and risk assessments at all scales of analysis (Pagani et al., 2014; Silva et al., 2014). The OpenQuake engine is used in this study to develop a national seismic risk model (CanadaSRM2) that estimates ground shaking hazards, physical risks and functional recovery metrics for over 2 million neighbourhoods across Canada. Dimensions of earthquake risk and functional recovery are reported for an aggregate asset portfolio of more than 9 million building archetypes through a framework of indicators designed to inform a wide range of emergency management, land use and financial planning decisions that are increasingly being considered in the broader context of policy goals established as part of the United Nations Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR 2015-2030), and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (refs). 


> Figure x: Seismic Risk Modeling Workflow

The seismic hazard and physical risk components of the national National probabilistic seimsic Risk Model (CanadaSRM2) are evaluated for return periods of 1/2,475 years (p= 2%/50 years; 0.000404 p.a.) and 1/475 years (p= 10%/50;0.0021 p.a.). The longer return period of 1/2475 years is used as a reference to estimate ground shaking hazards associated with rare but high consequence seismic events (maximum considered earthquake) that are relevant in evaluating the immediate impacts and consequences of future disasters. These include the risk of structural failure and/or loss of life resulting from the collapse of engineered structures during an earthquake event (critical buildings and related infrastructure systems), and the potential for cascading failures such as fire ignition and the disruption of essential lifeline services that may impact public safety and/or emergency response capabilities immediately after a disaster event. In this context, thresholds of risk tolerance are governed by design guidelines that are embedded in the National Building Code of Canada (NBCC 2015) and implemented through local and regional land use policies to ensure that buildings and related facilities are 'safe for the use intended.'

The shorter return period of 1/475 years is used as a reference to estimate ground shaking hazards that are relevant in evaluating risk-based performance targets for post-disaster recovery planning.  These include levels of building functionality and social disruption in the weeks and months following a disaster event, and the capacity to manage related economic losses resulting from a more likely but lower consequence 'design earthquake.' In this context, thresholds of risk tolerance are governed by a mix of sector-specific performance guidelines and social values that reflect who and what are considerd most vulnerable and in need of safeguarding.

### Seismic Hazard
Hazard potential is a measure of the intensity of shaking and related ground deformation that is likely to be experienced at any given location as a result of seismic energy generated by an earthquake event. Relevant ground shaking hazards for the 2020 Seisic Risk Model (CanadaSRM2) are based on the CanadaSHM6 version of the 2020 National Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Assessment developed by Kolaj etal., 2020 ([https://doi.org/10.4095/321473](https://doi.org/10.4095/321473). Ground motion intensities are reported for Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA), and for reference spectral acceleration periods of Sa(0.1), Sa(0.2), Sa(0.3), Sa(0.5), Sa(1.0), Sa(2.0), Sa(5.0) and Sa(10.0) seconds. Earthquake-triggered tsunami and secondary ground deformation hazards, including the effects of liquefaction and seismically-triggered landslides are known to represent significant additinal components of the overall seismic hazard threat. Although not considered in this iteration of the CanadaSRM2 model, these secondary hazards are very relevant to the assessment of risk to settled areas and critical infrastructure systems in many hotspot regions of concern across Canada, and are included in the scenario-based component of the national model (Hobbs et al., in prep) for regions in which geologic and topographic information is available to support more comprehensive assessment of multi-hazard hazard threats.  

> Figure x: 2020 National Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Assessment for Canada (CanadaSHM6-PSHA) representing spectral acceleration values at 0.2 seconds (damped at 5% for Site Class C) with a return period of 1/2475 years (p= 2%/50 years; 0.000404 p.e.). 

**Ground Shaknmg Hazard:** The OpenQuake-engine supports both Classical and Event-Based Probabilistic Sesimic Hazard Anlaysis (PSHA) of ground shaking hazards at specific locations of interest. The classical PSHA model allows the calculation of integrated hazard curves and hazard intensity parameters following an integrated methodology developed by Field et al., (2003), which incorporates analytic procedures intially formulated by Cornell (1968) and McGuire (1976). The classical PSHA model is used to analyze the hazard contributions from all known sesimic sources that are relevant for assessing dimensions of physical risk for an individual asset at a specific geographic location. For this reason, outputs of classical seismic hazard and risk models can not be aggregated for a portfolio of assets that extend over a broader region of interest (refs).  

The event-based PSHA model addresses this limitation by generating an integrated ground motion field that reflects the combined contributions from a representative suite of earthquake rupture scenarios for a given region and time horizon of interest. To ensure statistical convergence in both the seismic hazard and risk calculations, large stochastic event sets (SES) of earthquake ruptures are generated using a Monte Carlo sampling of logic trees that are embedded in the CanadaSHM6 model.  The logic tree for seismic source zones reflects our current scientific understanding of earth system processes that generate earthquake hazards in differnt tectonic regions across Canada (epistemic uncertainty), and provides a means of documenting this base of knowldge and propagating associated uncertainties through both hazard and risk calculations (refs; Adams et al.,). 

An accompanying logic tree ground motion prediction equations (gmpe's) is used to model the attenuation of seismic energy as it travels from the earthquake rupture zone to a point on the surface for different types of tectonic environments (subduction zone, crustal fault, stable crust, etc.). Each branch of the logic tree represents the expected attenuation characteristics for a specific tectonic environment using a corresponding subset of gmpe's that are weighted according to their expected contribution to the overall seismic hazard for that tectonic environment. For this iteration of the CanadaSRM2 risk model, we are using a uniform weighting based on spectral acceleration values at 0.3 seconds, as the variable weighting of gmpe's was not faound to have a significant influence on mean ground shaking intensity values (refs). The variability within and across attenuation models (aleatory uncertainty) is propogated through the calculation to estimate a the mean ground shaking intensity that a building is likely to experience at a specific geographic location. Outputs of event-based probabilistic hazard models are used to analyze the aggregated physical impacts and losses (seismic risk) for larger portfolios of assets that are distributed over a broader geographic region of interest for a specified set of return periods. 

**Site Amplification:** The compounding effects of local geological site conditions, which influence how seismic energy is either dampened or attenuated as it travels from the earthquake source zone up to the Earth's surface, are modeled in CanadaSRM2 using average shear wave velocity values within the upper 30-meter layer of mixed geological units (Vs30). Each of these units (bedrock and soil profiles) have a different set of site response characteristics that will determine the intensity of horizontal and vertical forces that are experienced by engineerd structures and people at the surface. 

The National Vs30 site model is a variable density grid that combines interpolated site values at a 5km grid spacing for the continental landmass of Canada (~2 million points), with higher density asset-level Vs30 site values for settled areas that are likely to experience levels of shaking of concern (PGA >0.17g). Regional Vs30 site conditions are interpolated from a global model developed by the US Geological Survey (Wald and Allen, refs) that utilizes high-resolution topographic data at a 1km grid spacing to infer surface exposures of crystalline bedrock, sedimentary layers and infill desposits of soil and anthropogenic materials. Asset-level site conditions are estimated by interpolating Vs30 values that lie between reference points of the 1km USGS global mosaic dataset. Wherever possible, these asset-level assessments of Vs30 are updated with the outputs of more detailed studies that directly measure 3-dimensional site response characteristics of geological meterials using a combination of direct obersation and geophysical techniques (refs). 

> Figure x: 2020 National site model for Canada (CanadaSHM6-PSHA) average shear wave velocities within the upper 30 meters of the Earth's surface (vs30) that are used to model the effects of local amplification and damping of seismic energy. 

In addition to  accounting for local geological conditions that influence the attenuation of seismic energy  as it travels through the upper upper 30-meter layer of material, the OpenQuake-engine also provides a capability to model deeper effects of tectonic setting in regions where there are buried sedimentary basins by including additional site parameters that measure the depth to which shear wave velocities become equal to 1.0 and 2.5 km/s.  Regional basin amplification occurs as seismic waves are reflected and/or refracted by subsurface structures resulting in constructive interference and the intensification of earthquake ground motions as they approach the Earth’s surface. Conversion of incident shear waves into longer-period and more destructive surface waveforms is caused by the reflection of seismic energy from dense sedimentary layers within the basin and from steep-walled structures along the basin edge. 

The amplification and modification of seismic energy will vary widely as a function of depth and location of the earthquake within the basin structure and the direction of wave propagation. The effects of regional basin amplification have been directly observed and measured in recent earthquake disasters such as Mexico City (1985) and Kobe, Japan (1995). Insights gained through modelling and real-time monitoring of these regions and comparable regions in Canada have shown that earthquake ground motions can be amplified by a factor of ~4-10 and can resonate more than three times longer than those which have not been influenced by regional subsurface basin structures [Bard and Bouchon, 1980; Graves, 1996; Molnar, 2012; Molnar et al., 2014].  For these reasons, it is essential to consider regional basin effects in situations where there is sufficient knowledge and capacity to model the amplification of seismic waves as they move through the Earth’s crust.

### Seismic Risk Analysis
The analysis of seismic risk provides insights on what we can expect in the event of future earthquake disasters, and underlying factors of the built environment and embedded socioeconomic systems that are driving changing patterns of risk over time.  Measures of existing earthquake hazard and risk are used by researchers working in academic, public and private sector domains to establish an understanding of cause-effect relationships and the probability of experiencing the negative impacts and societal consequences of a damaging earthquake at some point in the future.  Insights gained thorugh this research are relevant to regulatory authorities responsible for the safety and security of Canadians; emergency managers responsible for pre-event planning and capacity development for response and recovery;  insurance and reinsurance companies responsible for managing the expected economic impacts to asset owners, and; public sector organizations responsible for disaster relief and the recovery of socioeconomic systems following a major earthquake event. This collective and shared understanding of risk across research and practitioner communities is an essential foundation for identifying actionable strategies for increasing disaster resilience at a community level, and communicating these opportunities to residents and businesses most affected in ways that overcome current barriers to investing in risk reduciton and adaptation measures.

Information and knowledge about seismic risks in Canada has until recently been generated primarily using proprietary catastrophic loss modelling capabilities developed to meet the needs and operational requirements of the insurance and reinsurance sector, and the regulatory authorities that oversee the integrity and economic security of these financial institutions. This study builds on a broader initiative led by the Global Earthquake Model Foundation (GEM) to increase capabilties for harmonizing seismic hazard and risk assessments for use across provate and public sector domains.

Seismic risk is measured in terms of the anticipated negative consequences resulting from earthquake hazard events over a specified future time horizon:

> Seismic Risk = (consequence x probability)

Quantitative seismic risk models provide the capabilties required to measure the anticipated physical impacts and socioeconomic consequences of earthquake hazards for a given region and time horizon of interest. Seismic risk models for Canada have been developed using the OpenQuake engine; an open source computational platform established by the Global Earthquake Model Foundation to help promote a shared understanding of earthquake risk and increase capabilities for disaster risk reduction in the public domain. There are two methods of analyzing and measuring seismic risk, each designed with a specific purpose in mind.  

Deterministic or scenario-based models measure cause-effect relationships of a single earthquake rupture event of a given type, location, depth and magnitude. Elements of a scenario-based seismic assessment include predictions of surface ground shaking intensity at locations surrounding the earthquake rupture zone, and corresponding physical impacts (damages, injuries) and downstream consequences (economic losses, downtime) that are expected to result from the earthquake event. Scenario earthquake models are developed to provide insights on risks associated with earthquake hazards from known seismic source zones over a range of occurrence probabilities, or to simulate what might happen if a random earthquake event were to occur near a settled area at some point in the foreseeable future, a situation where the location and probability of occurrence is assumed to be almost certain (p=0.999).  Although not predictive, deterministic earthquake scenario models are effective in establishing a shared understanding of what can be expected in the event of a severe earthquake and in supporting risk management decisions that are often considered in the context of land use planning or emergency management.  They can be used to evaluate the efficacy of investing in risk reduction measures in advance of a disaster event,  or to increase capabilities to manage residual risks through emergency response and recovery operations.  
 
Probabilistic methods of seismic risk analysis are predictive models that anticipate the likely physical impacts and socioeconomic consequences of all known earthquake hazards for a given region over a specified future time horizon. They are specifically designed to support risk management decisions that need to be considered under conditions of moderate to high uncertainty.  Classical methods of probabilistic seismic risk analysis measure the impacts and consequences of known earthquake hazard threats with respect to an individual asset of concern for a given return period.  Outputs of these models are used to inform the development of seismic safety design standards for new construction, and to manage the risk to existing structures through investments in site-specific mitigation measures and/or earthquake insurance.  Event-based methods of probabilistic risk analysis utilize a representative catalog of earthquake rupture scenarios to model the likely impacts and consequences for a portfolio of assets for a given return period. Outputs of these models are used to establish profiles of earthquake risk within a region of interest, and to inform proactive investments in risk reduction and/or risk transfer strategies for a collection of assets that exceed tolerable thresholds of damage or loss.

### Earthquake Risk Metrics and Evaluation
Disaster resilience is an iterative process of planning and policy development through which knowledge about societal risk is transformed into actions that increase the capacities of a community to withstand, respond to, and recover from unexpected hazard events. In isolation, disaster resilience measures are effective in reducing intrinsic vulnerabilities and optimizing specific policy targets that promote the safety and security of a community.  When framed within the broader context of land use and comprehensive development, disaster resilience measures increase the capabilities of a community to anticipate and manage the dynamic forces of change, and to bounce back from catastrophic events that might otherwise undermine longer-term sustainability goals.

See discusison in Silva et.al.,2020). 

The framework of indicators presented in this study extends the scope of conventional seismic risk assessments to include measures of building damage,  casualties, socioeconomic disruption and functional recovery pathways that will be relevant to a broader range of planning domains. These include land use decisions that influence the creation of new risk through ongoing development in areas exposed to seismic hazards,  mitigation, adaptation and post-disaster recovery strategies that address risks to existing buildings that do not meet minimum performance thresholds, and emergency management plans that influence capabilities to withstand, respond to and recover from the residual risks of a future disaster event.

## Immediate Physical Impacts and Consequences
A familiar refrain from seismologists who study the physical impacts of major global disasters is that ‘earthquakes don’t kill people, buildings do.’  While the observation may be self-evident, the physical response of a building to chaotic patterns of vertical and horizontal forces caused by seismic waves rippling the Earth’s surface are extremely complex and difficult to predict. 

Building performance describes the capacity of an engineered structure to withstand and recover from the physical impacts of earthquake ground shaking and related secondary seismic hazards based on characteristics of both type and quality of construction. Measures include the number and types of buildings expected to sustain incremental levels of damage,  the functional capacity of these buildings and the implications for post-disaster response and recovery. The structural performance of engineered structures under conditions of severe ground shaking directly influences the safety and security of individuals, the extent of social disruption following an earthquake, and the longer-term economic security of a community. As such, it is an important measure of disaster resilience and the primary focus for risk reduction through investments in structural mitigation. 

Rudimentary seismic safety guidelines were introduced into the National Building Code of Canada in the early 1970s to minimize levels of damage for new construction and to ensure minimum thresholds of safety for people in areas exposed to severe earthquake hazards. These guidelines have since been revised through an iterative process of research and development that reflect both our evolving understanding of earthquake hazards in Canada, and the detailed response characteritcis of engineered structures subjected to moderate and extreme seismic loads (Adams; NRC refs). Though our seismic building code has not yet been thoroughly tested, it is clear from recent earthquakes in Chile and New Zealand that the adoption of modern seismic design guidelines are effective in saving lives and reducing injuries in newer buildings. However, enforcement of these guidelines only applies to new construction and/or buildings undergoing significant renovation as part of the development approval process.  

A secondary consideration is that existing standards for seismic design do not take into account non-structural impacts and consequences of earthquake ground shaking. These can include damages and related injuries caused by the failure of facades, ceilings and other non-load bearing architectural elements during the shaking event, and damages to mechanical and electrical systems that are essential for ongoing building functionality.  While the building may survive the immediate effects of ground shaking and provide minimum safety thresholds, the impacts of non-structural damages can be substantially greater than those inflicted by structural damage alone, often rendering a building unusable and in need of major repair or replacement. 

From the perspective of planning and policy-development, the intent is to maximize the capacity of buildings to withstand and recover from the likely impacts of earthquake damages through strategic investments in land use and/or seismic retrofit measures that reduce physical vulnerabilities and the loss of functionality following a major earthquake . Key performance measures include the effectiveness of these measures in reducing the number of structures likely to sustain extensive and/or complete damage (resistance), and the number of days needed to restore baseline levels of functionality (recovery). Emergency planning and related operations are focused on managing residual risks by increasing capabilities to anticipate, plan for, withstand, respond to and recover from the negative impacts of an earthquake disaster. In this context, building performance indicators are used primarily to increase situational awareness about which structures are likely to collapse or sustain damage beyond repair, and the cascading implications for life safety, mass care, damage inspections, social displacement, debris removal and longer-term prospects for recovery. 

### Structural Damage
The OpenQuake building damage models use outputs of both classical and event-based PSHA seismic hazard assessments to estimate the probability of exceeding reference thresholds of structural damage for a given building asset at a specific geographic location and intensity of ground shaking. Damage state thresholds are based on a suite of integrated fragility and vulnerability functions that have been developed to assess performance characteristics of all 136 unique building taxonomies represented in the Physical Exposure Model for Canada (Journeay et al., 2020; Martins and Silva, 2020). Fragility functions describe the probability of exceeding a predefined set of building damage thresholds (limit states) over a range of ground shaking intensity levels. Shaking intensities reflect combinations of both horizontal and vertical forces generated by seismic waves interacting with the Earth's surface over a range of frequencies (site periods). The probability of meeting or exceeding specific thresholds of damage for a given level of shaking is dependent on the structural integrity of load-bearing elements and their connections to roof and exterior wall systems for specific types of building construction.  

The fragility models used in this study are based on capacity curves initially developed as part of the HAZUS loss estimation methodology developed in the United States by FEMA and the National Institute of Building Sciences (FEMA 2011), and a selection of reference ground motion records for representative seismic soource zones across North America (REF). Each capacity curve (i.e. one per building class) is used to define a single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) oscillator, which is then tested against the set of ground motion records using nonlinear time history analysis. The response characteristics, measured in terms of maximum displacement and acceleration, are used to compute the probability of exceeding a number of damage states (i.e. slight, moderate, extensive and complete) as defined in the HAZUS implementation guideline (FEMA, 2011).  A thorough description of this procedure can be found in Martins and Silva (2019). Updated fragility functions are under development for wood and concrete building types that reflect context-specific Canadian construction practices, and that are known to have very different seismic response characteristics than their North American counterparts (Bebamzadeh et al., 2018). A hybrid model encompassing both representative North American and Canadian-specific fragility functions is used in this version of the CanadaSRM2 model to assess the overall building performance characteristics of existing buildings. A related suite of vulnerability and consequence functions are used to assess probability distributions over a range of hazard intensity levels and the ratios of injury, loss and disruption that are relevant for risk reduction and response/recovery planning. 

> Figure x: Reference damage states used in the National Sesimic Risk Model for Canada and corresponding fragility functions for representative wood and concrete construction types

The capacity of building systems to withstand the effects of earthquake ground shaking has evolved since the introduction of specific seismic design guidelines into the National Building Code for Canada in the early 1970’s.  As such, the analysis of damage potential requires a separate fragility function for every unique combination of building construction type and seismic design level. The assignment of seismic design level for each asset in the portfolio is based on a combination of construction year and the intensity of ground shaking assessed at a probability threshold of 2% in 50 year (see Table x). Accommodations are made to reflect the enhanced ductility of typical single family residential wood frame buildings (W1), which are generally not subject to a formal seismic engineering review; and the intrinsic physical vulnerabilities of older unreinforced masonry construction (URM) and mixed concrete/steel frame buildings with unreinforced masonry infill walls (C3 and S5), which generally predate the enforcemenet of seismic safety design guidelines in the National Building Code of Canada.

Outputs of OpenQuake damage models are used to assess performance characteristics with respect to both established life-safety guidelines embedded in the National Building Code of Canada (NBCC 2015), and to inform the development of performance targets that support seismic retrofit policy and related disaster resilience planning intiatives at local and regional scales. Life-safety threshods are based on a recommended uniform collapse probability of no more than 1% in 50 years (ASCE/SEI 7-10, 2010). Functional building performance targets are based on general guidelines established as part of FEMA's seismic performance assessment methodology for existing buildings (FEMA P-58-1, 2013 and 2018) and the resilience-based earthquake design initiative (REDi; Amulfi and Wilford, 2013). Although designed for the integrated assessment of individual building components, the same overall approach and analytic methodology is used in this study to evaluate the performance of more generalized building archetypes.

### Disaster Debris

### Affected People

Unlike other disaster types, the impacts of an earthquake event are experienced over a period of minutes, and can be repeated in aftershock sequences that can last several weeks or months.  Understanding the population dynamics of a community and the proportions of the population likely to be in buildings of different types over a 24-hour period is essential for estimating injuries and fatalities at the time of an earthquake. We use a Canadian adaptation of the HAZUS and PAGER methodologies (FEMA, 2011; Jaiswal & Wald, 2014) to estimate average building populations at different times of the day based on the number, square footage and mix of functional building types for a given area. Neighbourhood-level populations are estimated for standard workday hours when people are at an office, school or other group facility (9am-5pm); for morning and evening commute hours when people are in transit (7am-9am; 5pm-7pm), and; for evening hours when the majority of people are at home (7pm-7am).

## Disaster Risk Reduction
The use of seismic risk models to evaluate ‘what-if’ planning scenarios sheds light on opportunities to reduce escalating patterns of seismic risk through sustainable land use planning, the enforcement of design codes for new construction, proactive investments in seismic retrofit of existing structures, and strategies to more effectively manage residual risk and increase neighbourhood resilience during response and recovery phases of a future disaster event. 

Measures of risk reduction are evaluated in terms of physical, social and economic losses avoided as a result of implementing mitigation and/or adaptation measures , the anticipated costs to implement these measures, and expected societal benefits in terms of both financial returns on investment and increased capacities to withstand, respond to and recover from a future disaster event. Information and knowledge gained through the evaluation of risk reduction alternatives is primarily relevant to land use and community planners responsible for sustainable development of the built environment and related socioeconomic systems; residents and business owners responsible for asset management, and; and policy analysts responsible for developing actionable strategies for disaster risk reduction across all sectors of society.
